Daily rough-edge fixes found by walking the app like a new user on a phone (390x844). Newest at the bottom.

## 2026-11-05

Walked /welcome, /trending, /live, /story, /account, /brain on the live site. No page errors, no 4xx/5xx, no horizontal overflow.

Found:
- Brain page, strategist leaderboard: "live: +2.1 pts on 1999" reads like the year 1999 (it is 1,999 graded calls).
- Brain page, smarter #1 pick card: "Tested on 2707 past calls" had no thousands separator, unlike every other count on the page.
- Brain page, health line said "Last market grading 23h ago" while the activity feed right below said "The market graded 118 picks 13h ago". The line only read the daily grade-and-train job's timestamp; the hourly catch-up grades picks too (/v4/brain: health.grading.at 2026-11-04 22:48 UTC, latest graded event 2026-11-05 08:18 UTC).
- Brain page, "It grades itself": the "On probation" pill wrapped onto two lines at 390px.
- Moving now (/trending): every "What it could mean" line ended in a double period ("...next year..") because the hunch already ends with one and the UI added another.

Changed:
- Leaderboard shows "live: +2.1 pts / over 1,999 calls" (two short lines so strategist names don't get truncated).
- Counts use thousands separators; probation/rejected pills never wrap.
- Health line uses the latest of the daily job and any graded activity, so it matches the feed; it still flags a daily run that didn't finish.
- Hunch text has trailing punctuation stripped before the single period is added.

Checks: vite build passes, payoff/figures tests pass, backend tests 98 passed. Verified locally against the live API with mobile screenshots.
