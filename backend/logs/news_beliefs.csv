This agreement represents a significant move forward for Roku. Although the stock has encountered some headwinds over the past year, this new development once again highlights why Roku stock is worth investing in for those focused on the long game. Let's dig deeper into this partnership between Roku and Amazon -- as well as the rest of the former's business -- to understand why.</p><p>Amazon is a notable player in the connected TV (CTV) market.
