This strategy involves buying a call option, which gives you the right to buy the underlying stock at a fixed price (the strike price) before a certain date (the expiration date). If NVDA's price goes up, as you predict, you can buy the stock at the lower strike price and sell it at the higher market price for a profit. The risk is that if NVDA's price doesn't exceed the strike price, the option will expire worthless and you will lose the premium you paid.\"}"}
