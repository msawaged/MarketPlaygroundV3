AGG provides broad exposure to U.S. investment-grade bonds, IEF targets mid-term (7-10 year) U.S. Treasuries, and SHY targets short-term (1-3 year) U.S. Treasuries. This strategy staggers the maturity dates, which can provide a steady stream of income. The risk profile is moderate, as bonds are generally considered safer than equities, but there is still a risk of loss if interest rates increase. The target return is moderate to reflect the lower risk nature of bonds compared to equities.'}"}
