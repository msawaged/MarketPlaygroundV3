If the user's belief is correct and Apple beats earnings leading to a spike in the stock price, this will increase the value of the call option, leading to a profit. The max loss is the premium paid for the call option, which occurs if AAPL price ends below the strike at expiration. The target return is set at 20% which might be achieved if AAPL spikes significantly post earnings. This strategy is suitable for moderate risk profile as it has a defined risk (the premium paid) and potentially high reward.\"}"}
