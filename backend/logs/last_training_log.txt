Belief: I want to 2x my money on NVDA this month
User: anonymous
Strategy: {'type': 'Long Call', 'trade_legs': [{'action': 'buy', 'quantity': 1, 'contract': 'call', 'strike': 160, 'expiration': '2021-12-31'}], 'target_return': 100, 'max_loss': 100, 'time_to_target': '1 month', 'explanation': "The Long Call option strategy is a basic options strategy that bets on a significant upward price movement of the underlying asset. In this case, buying a call option on NVDA with a strike price close to the current price level, expecting the price of NVDA to double within the month. This fits the user's belief as the potential return could be very high if NVDA does indeed double. However, the user needs to be aware that the potential loss could also be 100% of the investment if the price of NVDA does not go above the strike price of 160 by the end of the month."}
