Belief: Apple will beat earnings and spike after hours
User: local_test
Strategy: {'type': 'Long Call', 'trade_legs': ['buy 1 call 220 strike'], 'expiration': '2023-03-17', 'target_return': 20, 'max_loss': 100, 'time_to_target': '2 weeks', 'explanation': "The strategy involves buying a call option on AAPL with a strike price slightly higher than the current stock price. If the user's belief is correct and Apple beats earnings leading to a spike in the stock price, this will increase the value of the call option, leading to a profit. The max loss is the premium paid for the call option, which occurs if AAPL price ends below the strike at expiration. The target return is set at 20% which might be achieved if AAPL spikes significantly post earnings. This strategy is suitable for moderate risk profile as it has a defined risk (the premium paid) and potentially high reward."}
