This allows the user to profit from the anticipated price increase of Apple shares, while exposing the user to a limited risk (the premium paid for the option). The strike price of 195 is chosen as it is slightly above the latest price, and the option will become profitable if Apple shares increase beyond this strike price. The expiration date is set to 6 months in the future, in anticipation of the earnings release and subsequent stock price movement."
