2025-07-07T00:38:44.776322,Prediction: Nvidia Will Soar in the Second Half,"<p><strong>Nvidia</strong> <span class=""ticker"">(NASDAQ: NVDA)</span> was a surefire winner for investors over the past two calendar years. The artificial intelligence (AI) giant soared more than 800% over that time as it wowed investors with its explosive earnings growth. And as they aimed to get in on the AI growth story, Nvidia seemed like the obvious choice. After all, this tech player sells the world's top-performing AI chips, a critical product for customers building AI platforms.</p><p>But earlier this year, Nvidia stock slid into the doldrums alongside the rest of the tech market. This happened as investors worried about the impact of U.S. import tariffs on the consumer and corporate earnings. The idea was that this could lead to companies reining in spending, which might include lower spending on AI, potentially bad news for Nvidia. On top of this, U.S. controls on chip exports to China also weighed on Nvidia's growth potential.</p><p>These concerns resulted in a decline of nearly 30% in Nvidia stock from the start of the year through early April. Since then, though, the stock and the general market have rebounded and even gone on to advance. Nvidia has climbed more than 60% from its low, while the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> and the <strong>Nasdaq</strong> have both recorded new record highs. Now, my prediction is that this movement isn't over, and Nvidia will soar in the second half. Let's find out why.</p><p><a href=""https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/06/prediction-nvidia-will-soar-in-the-second-half/?source=iedfolrf0000001"">Continue reading</a></p>","Prediction: Nvidia Will Soar in the Second Half. <p><strong>Nvidia</strong> <span class=""ticker"">(NASDAQ: NVDA)</span> was a surefire winner for investors over the past two calendar years.
