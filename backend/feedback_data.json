This fund invests in companies from the energy sector, primarily in the oil and gas industry. By buying equity, you stand to gain from any potential upside in the sector over the next year. However, given the volatility in oil prices, there's also a risk of losing part of your investment if the sector underperforms. A 10% return is targeted over a 12-month period with a maximum loss of 5%, in line with a moderate risk profile."

The max loss is the premium paid for the call option, which occurs if AAPL price ends below the strike at expiration.
