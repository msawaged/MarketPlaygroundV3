Key factors include stable demand for Nvidia's GPUs and data center solutions. Risks include sudden price movements due to market news, thus risk management involves monitoring the position closely and exiting if the price breaches the wings of the condor. The exit criteria involve either reaching the target return of 15% or closing the position before the last week of expiration to avoid gamma risk."

    "explanation": "Given the neutral sentiment surrounding NVDA, this Iron Condor strategy takes advantage of a range-bound market. The strike prices are selected based on the current price and the recommended range. The put spread ($161-$164) and call spread ($175-$178) provide a wide enough range for NVDA to fluctuate without causing a loss. Key catalysts include market sentiment, earnings reports, and changes in the technology sector. Risk management involves monitoring the position and adjusting accordingly. If NVDA breaks out of the range, the position could be adjusted to limit the loss. The maximum loss is the difference in strike prices minus the premium received. The position benefits from time decay and low volatility. Exit criteria include reaching 50% of the maximum profit or a significant change in market sentiment.",
